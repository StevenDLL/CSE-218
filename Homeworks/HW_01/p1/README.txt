-SEQUENTIAL SEARCH:
A sequential search is meant to look "linear" but when you take a look at the numbers you get from part b of the homework you will realize that it doesn't
look like you'd expect it to. The reason for this is because you wont always have a worst case scenario which would cause it to look more "linear". In plain words,
with this algorithm the average time it takes to search will increase linearly with the size of the array.

-BINARY SEARCH:
Unlike sequential search binary search requires the array to be in ascending order, this is due to the fact that binary search will compare the "key value" to
whatever the value in the middle of the array is and go from there. The time complexity of binary search is Log2(n) and from the results we get in part c of the
homework id have to agree. As the size of the array increases the amount of time the algorithm takes stays about the same.
